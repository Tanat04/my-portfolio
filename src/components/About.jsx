          Hi there! My name's Tanat and I'm 19 years old. I come from Bangkok, 
          Thailand and I'm currently a student at Assumption University, studying 
          computer science. I really enjoy working with others and constantly 
          learning new things. In fact, I've been studying web development 
          for about 6 months now, and I've already gained some skills in 
          both front-end and back-end development. <br />
          <br /> Aside from self-study, I also enjoy learning from experienced 
          people and working on interesting projects. This has been a great way 
          for me to continue to learn and expand my skillset. <br />
          <br /> In the future, I plan on improving my skills even more, part
          icularly in the field of game development. I think it would be a 
          really exciting challenge and a great way to apply what I've learned 
          so far. So, that's a bit about me and my goals. Thanks for reading!
